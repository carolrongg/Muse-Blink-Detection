# Muse-Blink-Detection
This code will detect if you blink or not with the Muse Headband. Clone this repository and once you blink, the code will pick up the signals and print the word "blink" in the terminal. 

This is adapted from Alexandre Barachant's Muselsl code. Full credits to https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl 

A beginner's guide to creating and installing this can be found in this article I wrote. Check it out if you're unsure how to install everything.
